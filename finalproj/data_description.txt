Number of Nodes: 244
Number of Edges: 250

Qualities of the Graph:
* Directed value graph, the graph will display the Amtrack routes from one station to another, each edge will represent 
the train going one way.
*There will be no self edges, because we will not allow for loops, or a train leaving off and ending up at the same station 
*Duplicate Edges are okay, because there will be trains that leave from station A and arrive in station B, 
as well as trains that leave from station B, and arrive in station A. These two trains will be counted as separate yet 
duplicate edges in our graph.
*Our graph will have edges connecting the different nodes, or in our case, stations according to our data sets. 
*Our graph will have edges that have values, because the edges will hold the data with the distance in miles from 
one node to the next (we will assume these distances are straight lines connecting each station since location data in our 
dataset is only listed as x and y coordinates, distance will be calculated using Pythagorean theorem).
*This graph will not account for connections, it will be direct trains only. In our output section, we will give the user the 
information on how to get from one station to another, and will state the connections needed if there is no direct train.
*In our documentation, there were some errors in the data formatting, not the data itself. For these issues in format, we
 deleted them ourselves.
*For simplicity, we also decided to get rid of the address of the station, and only use the station 3 letter code to identify

*We had to parse down our data to make it more manageable, we decided to only make a graph of a few routes
The routes we choose:
-Texas eagle
-Vermonter
-City of new orleans
-Coast starlight
Because we were only using specific routes, we deleted all other information on stations that were not used

*After reading in our data, we realized it didnâ€™t have any information regarding connections. It only has the 
coordinates and names of stations individually. After looking for a different dataset and not finding any that met all of our 
needs, we decided to edit the dataset we have now to add connecting stations based on specific Amtrak routes (see above).

*Now our data set contains the station, its previous station, and the station that comes next on the amtrack routes.
