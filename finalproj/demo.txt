DEMOOOOOOO:

Not really sure how to do this, but can walk you through how to run our program Haile <3

FIRST: USER INPUT:
*go to userInput.txt and enter two stations you want to go to.
    * they must be on one of the 4 routes we chose to inlcude, we have given some examples, and you can see more
        station options in routes.txt
    
ex:
Enter your Start Destination (ex: CHI, LAX, WNR, etc):
NOL
Enter your End Destination(ex: NOL, WAS, NHT, etc):
LAX 

*next, once you have editied the userInput.txt, you MUST COMMIT the changes

SECOND: Build and run the program throuh Gradle

If you want to see a graph display of all the stations in the data set, UNCOMMENT the GraphDisplay labeled 
"allRoutes", and COMMENT out the Graph Display "choosenRoute"

*Otherwise, if you would like to see the graph display of the routes you have choosen, UNCOMMENT "choosenRoute" 
and COMMENT out "allRoutes"

*The basic stats will always be for the graph for the user's choosen route.

SCREEN SHOT: 
*if the user enters NOL to LAX, the graphical output will be :
can be seen in screenshot1.png

You can also manipulate the nodes to see the edges, direction 
and stations more clearly.
seen in screenshot2.png

Text output if you use LAX to NOL should be:
number of nodes is: 60
average degree is: 1.97
number of edges: 59
maximum degree: 2
total distance traveled: 2862 miles
