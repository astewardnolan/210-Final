DEMOOOOOOO:

Not really sure how to do this, but can walk you through how to run our program Haile <3

FIRST: USER INPUT:
*go to userInput.txt and enter two stations you want to go to.
    * they must be on one of the 4 routes we chose to inlcude, we have given some examples, and you can see more
        station options in routes.txt
    
ex:
Enter your Start Destination (ex: CHI, LAX, WNR, etc):
NOL
Enter your End Destination(ex: NOL, WAS, NHT, etc):
LAX 

*next, once you have editied the userInput.txt, you MUST COMMIT the changes

SECOND: Build and run the program throuh Gradle

If you want to see a graph display of all the stations in the data set, UNCOMMENT the GraphDisplay labeled 
"allRoutes", and COMMENT out the Graph Display "choosenRoute"

*Otherwise, if you would like to see the graph display of the routes you have choosen, UNCOMMENT "choosenRoute" 
and COMMENT out "allRoutes"

*The basic stats will always be for the graph for the user's choosen route.

SCREEN SHOT: 
*if the user enters NOL to LAX, the graphical output will be :
